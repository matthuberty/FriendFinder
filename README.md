# FriendFinder
Created during Week #13 of UC Davis Coding Bootcamp.  The goal was to create a Friend Finder app using Node and Express servers.  The user enters a home splash page that directs to a survey page.  When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.
